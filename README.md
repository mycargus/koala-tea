A practical science- and code-driven guide to building Quality software

## The Problem

Software development is hard. Perhaps like us you've had thoughts like these:

> "I've read about dependency injection but I don't know how to implement it in
> this legacy project codebase."
>
> "What does SOLID code actually look like? Is it a unicorn?"
>
> "What are the *proven* best practices for writing testable code? I'm tired of
> fad approaches."

Worst of all, if you write poor code then you will inevitably regret it.
Prohibitive maintenance costs bring projects to a slow crawl. Most programmers
agree automated testing helps, but not many understand how to do it effectively
and efficiently, which only adds to the technical debt.

Folks may gradually improve with experience, books, and blogs, and if they're
lucky they'll stumble upon the best ones. Even then, how does one know whether
their resources espouse scientifically proven methods or yet another anecdotal
"this worked great for me but your mileage may vary" suggestion? Science and
experimentation ought to be our authoritative guidepost, not experience.

There must be a better way to do software.

## Mission

This project has one simple goal in mind:

**Honestly help people to produce high
quality software by teaching one proven principle at a time in a digestable,
modular format.**

## Vision

We strive to explain the Why, How, When, and Where to practice the principles
taught in this project. Furthermore, we hope to make the content more useful and
digestable by providing code examples to demonstrate the principles in practice.
The more languages, the better!

Specifically we focus on how to write code with the following attributes:

-   Testable
-   Maintainable

We also aim to provide empirical evidence and case studies to back up our claims
and reasoning.

Above all, we aim to be honest. If we don't have scientific evidence to back up
the principle, then we will cautiously consider whether we should add it to the
project. If we do, then we'll clearly label our material to differentiate
between science and "XP".
